# Automated Luxury Parking System

Ryan Petrauskas and Livy Bottomley

The Windshield Wiper Control System in Project 3 enhances driving convenience and safety by creating windshield wiper functions in various driving conditions. The system ensures that the engine is only started when both the driver and passenger seats are occupied, and both seatbelts are fastened. The wipers can operate in four modes: high-speed, low-speed, intermittent, and off. In the intermittent mode, the user can select from three different delay times: short, medium, or long. The wipers will only function if the engine is running, and they will stop when the engine is turned off. At high-speed, the servo moves at 40 rpm and 30 rpm at low-speed. If the engine or wipers are turned off, the wipers will move back to their original position.

In this project, we chose to use a position servo motor to simulate the windshield wiper motor. The reason for this choice is that position servo motors allow precise control over the wiper's position. This is ideal for accurately simulating the movement of the wipers from one end of the windshield to the other. Additionally, position servos can hold a specific position until instructed to move again, which is an important trait for the movement of windshield wipers.
