# Automated Luxury Underground Parking System

Ryan Petrauskas and Brandon Mori

# Project Description
Luxury underground parking in heavily populated urban areas like Manhattan demands enhanced security, convenience, and safety for vehicle owners. Existing parking systems often lack sufficient access control and collision prevention mechanisms, increasing the risk of unauthorized access and potential accidents within parking spaces. This creates a need for a more secure and user-friendly solution that provides peace of mind while ensuring efficient vehicle management.


We propose an automated underground parking system designed to enhance security, safety, and user convenience. The system utilizes an LDR sensor to detect vehicle presence at the entrance gate, which can be unlocked using a matrix keypad for secure code-based access. LED indicators (red and green) inside the parking area guide the driver on when it is safe to enter. At the same time, an ultrasonic distance sensor helps prevent collisions by triggering a buzzer alert when the vehicle is too close to the wall. For a seamless exit, an exit button opens the gate, allowing the driver to back out safely. Additionally, a button inside the parking spot enables the driver to change the matrix keypad code, with updates displayed on the serial monitor for enhanced security control.

# Wiper Modes  

| Mode    | Potentiometer Range | Behavior                                                  |
|---------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **HI**  | >= 0.75             | Wipers move at high speed                                 |
| **LO**  | 0.50 - 0.75         | Wipers move at low speed                                  |
| **INT** | 0.25 - 0.50         | Wipers move at low speed, with given delay between sweeps |
| **OFF** | < 0.25              | Wipers do not move and remain stationary                  |

# Intermittent Delay Time Modes  

| Mode       | Potentiometer Range | Behavior                            |
|------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **LONG**   | >= 0.66             | 8-second delay between wiper sweeps |
| **MEDIUM** | 0.66 - 0.33         | 6-second delay between wiper sweeps |
| **SHORT**  | < 0.33              | 3-second delay between wiper sweeps |
